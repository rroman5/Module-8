#Problem 1
#This Problem will take two inputs given from the user and print wether they are equal or not.
x = int(input("Insert number "))
y = int(input("Insert another number "))
def equal(num1,num2):
        if int(num1) == int(num2):
                print("Numbers are equal")
        else:
                print("Not equal")
equal(x,y)

#Problem 2
#This problem we will write a function that takes two inputs from a user and prints whether the sum is greater than 10,
#less than 10, or equal to 1

def greater_equal_less (num1,num2):
        sum = num1 + num2

#Problem 3
# â€“ Write a function that takes a list and prints if the value 5 is in that list.
z = [5,7,10,2,]

#Problem 4
#Write a function that takes a year as a parameter and returns True if the year is a
#leap year, False if it is otherwise.
#Consider the requirements of a leap year:
#The year is evenly divisible by 4
#If the year can be evenly divided by 100 it is NOT a leap year, unless:
#oIf the year is also evenly divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.
